### ✨ ABOUT ME ✨
Hi to you, my name is Amara! I am a avid coder and student who attends the University of Michigan! (#GoWolverines)
I currently live in Ann Arbor but my hometown is in NYC! I have multiple hobbies outside of coding including boxing, ballet, ranged shooting and sketching fashion designs!
